# test-immutability
My first steps work with NodeJS, Express, NestJS, Swagger, MongoDB, PostgreSQL, Microservices, RabbitMQ, WebSocket, DevOps basics (docker + kubernetes + jenkins), SOLID, Hexagonal architecture, SAGA,front-end basics.

I am a student of a wonderful team "IT-KAMASUTRA" that give education to the front-end and back-end. These are my first steps in this area and the project is being written from scratch with the knowledge gained here. I highly recommend this team to everyone https://it-incubator.ru
